# robymontyz's dotfiles

![Screenshot of my shell prompt and workflow using GNU Screen](assets/workflow.png)

## Dependencies

* git

* rsync

* screen (version >4.01, see more details below)

* gpg [optional]

* OpenSSH [optional]

* Xcode [optional]

## Installation

**Warning:** These dotfiles are suited mostly on my needs for macOS. If you want to try them, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you donâ€™t want or need. **Use at your own risk!**

**Compatibility:** while those settings are mostly for macOS, they will work on Linux system too without some macOS-specific settings.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robymontyz/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source .scripts/import_bash_settings.sh
```

You can clone/download the repository wherever you want. The script will copy the files in the user home folder.

## Configurations included

* ### Bash

	* `.bashrc`

	* `.bash_profile`

	* `.inputrc`

* ### zsh

	* `.zshrc`

	* `.zprofile`

* ### ViM

	* `.vimrc`

	* italian spelling dictionary

	* *Solarized Dark* theme

	* plugins:

		- [Smart Tabs](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=231)

* ### Git

	* `.gitconfig`

	* `.gitignore` sample

	* global `.gitignore` sample (`.config/git/ignore`)

* ### GNU Screen

	* `.screenrc`

	**Warning**

	```
	You need GNU Screen with support to vertical split:
	- GNU Screen >4.01 natively supports vertical splitting.	
	- GNU Screen <4.01 may not support vertical splitting without [the patch](http://fungi.yuggoth.org/vsp4s/). Unfortunately the download link is broken.
	```

	In a standard macOS installation, GNU Screen version is probably <4.01, so I strongly recommend to install the latest version with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

* ### SSH

	* SSH keys

	* `ssh_config` and `sshd_config`

	**N.B.** *My SSH keys, obviously, are not actually included in this repo but you can add them by yourself inside `.ssh/` folder.*

* ### Various personal shell scripts

* ### Install and export scripts

	* `import_bash_settings.sh` (see [Installation](#installation))

	* `export_bash_settings.sh`

	*You can manually specify a backup directory where to export files with `export_bash_settings.sh` modifying `$BACKUPDIR` inside the script.*

	*Same applies to `import_bash_settings.sh`.*

* ### Crontab

	Deprecated in favor of launchd agents.
